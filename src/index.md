# A tiny, one-day conference in the Sussex countryside with nice people, good food and thought-provoking talks.

This year we’re exploring Kevin Kelly’s notion: Over the long term, the future is decided by optimists.

Agree? Not sure? We’ve invited some brilliant people to help you decide. You’ll hear from designers, storytellers and neuroscientists while enjoying the beautiful surroundings of the Artelium Wine Estate. 

If none of that works you can rely on a healthy picnic lunch, excellent coffee or just wait until the closing feast to find out what everyone else thinks.
